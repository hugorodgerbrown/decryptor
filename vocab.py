"""Vocabulary sources for Decryptor.

Two jobs, deliberately separated:

  words   — what counts as a legal word (single-word answers, combo fallback)
  phrases — what counts as a real multi-word answer

Sources, and what each one can and cannot tell us:

  UKACD     250k entries built for UK advanced cryptics, 53k of them
            multi-word. Attests, but carries no frequency data.
  WordNet   64k multi-word lemmas. Overlaps UKACD by only 13k, so the two are
            complementary rather than redundant; the union is ~105k.
  wordfreq  Zipf frequencies. Ranks, but attests nothing crossword-specific.

This file is the quality ceiling of the whole product. It is the only place
that changes when you want better answers.
